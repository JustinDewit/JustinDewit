# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Justin

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer driven by a passion for transforming ideas into real-world applications.  
My work spans both **Python** and **JavaScript (TypeScript)**, where I specialize in crafting dynamic and scalable solutions across the entire stack.

### I usually build with:

- **Frontend:** React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Scalable APIs using FastAPI and Node.js
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL and MongoDB (SQL & NoSQL)
- **Tools & Platforms:** Deploying with AWS and Vercel

I also regularly work with Python and its amazing ecosystem, building APIs with FastAPI, writing testable, maintainable code,  
and integrating a range of libraries to optimize backend performance.
