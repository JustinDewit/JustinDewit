Hi, I'm [Justin de Wit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justindewit/).

Some of my personal projects (mostly still under construction):
- [NASA API NAVIGATOR](https://github.com/JustinDewit/nasa-api-navigator) Explore NASA's satellite data and real-time Earth observations via a user-friendly interface.
- [AWS BATCH CALLER](https://github.com/JustinDewit/AWS-BATCH-CALLER) Trigger custom batch jobs for web scraping.

Reach out through my personal website [justindewit.com](https://www.justindewit.com/) if you want to hire me (open to part-time and full-time)

Have a nice day!
